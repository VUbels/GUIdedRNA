# GUIdedRNA

A comprehensive Shiny application for guided RNA-seq analysis including quality control, preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and cell type annotation.

## Features and workflow

1. **Setup**: Upload 10X Genomics data (or any .mtx/barcode/feature combination) or folder containing multiple datasets
2. **Sample Information**: Add metadata and sample attributes
3. **Quality Control**: Set filtering parameters and visualize QC metrics
4. **Preprocessing**: Run doublet removal, unannotated gene removal, and ambient RNA correction
5. **LSI Round 1**: Initial dimensionality reduction
6. **Broad Clustering**: Assign broad cell types using marker genes and visualize any gene expression in UMAP
7. **LSI Round 2**: Refined analysis on cell type subsets
8. **Final Clustering**: Detailed cell type annotation and visualize any gene expression in UMAP per subcluster
9. **Integration**: Combine all results into final annotations
10. **Download**: Export processed data and results

## Installation and regular use

**For Regular Users (Recommended)**
No technical knowledge required - just double-click and wait!  

### Windows/IOS/Linux Users
1) Download this repository (green "Code" button â†’ "Download ZIP")

   - **IOS/Linux:** Double-click INSTALL_AND_RUN.sh
6) Let Docker build container (5-15 minutes)
7) If browser does not open simply go to http://localhost:3838

**When using app, your directories are found in host_drives!**

After building docker container is completed once, subsequently running app is instantaneous. Refresh browser if connection cannot be found. 

## For Advanced Users & Developers
WSL2 Users (Windows Subsystem for Linux)  
If you need Windows drive access and advanced volume mounting:  
Run through command line with ADVANCED_DEPLOY.sh
If working through command line simply open in any browser at http://localhost:3838
